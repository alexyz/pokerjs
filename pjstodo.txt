draw doesn't give any outs - needs a board
draw/he gives error if hands blank/1 card
hilo should probably say no low if anyone else has a low on river
hide high half/low half/total in hover if not a hilo game

hilo - show h/l outs in different colours
draw should hide board
draw - exact draw when 2 cards remaining
draw doesn't give ranks with card missing
low draw - info needs low hand names
change of hand card should clear calc?


keylistener for entering hands?

ability to add/remove hands
ability to set blockers
drag and drop of cards
hilo eq calc seems slow

add these games
