holdem on turn gives 44 outs but only 43 samples...
use objects.freeze more
need copy method instead of using slice
win/tie/total should be win/tie/lose/total
draw doesn't give any outs - needs a board
hilo doesn't give smilely face for winning low on river, should probably also say no low if anyone has a low
low draw not working
low outs seem to be whole deck if already has only low on flop

hilo - show h/l outs in different colours
draw should hide board
draw - exact draw when 2 cards remaining
draw doesn't give ranks with card missing
low draw - info needs low hand names
change of hand card should clear calc?
disable text selection
cookie to remember game
keylistener for entering hands
click instead of hover on outs for mobile
ability to add/remove hands
ability to set blockers
drag and drop of cards
